# BCData

A collection of battle cats game data.

This repo contains all server files and DataLocal and resLocal for various game versions.

It is used in my [BCSFE](https://codeberg.org/fieryhenry/BCSFE-Python) for cat names and stat data.

Using a self hosted forgejo instance as the repo is quite large.

The scripts in this repo use [Apkdown](https://codeberg.org/fieryhenry/apkdown) and
[TBCTK](https://codeberg.org/fieryhenry/tbctk) (not yet released).
